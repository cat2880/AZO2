# Analysis of Execution Time of Graph Algorithms

## Project Description

The project aims to analyze and compare the execution times of various graph algorithms, such as Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms and shortest path algorithms. The analyzed algorithms include Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for MST and Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford's algorithms for the shortest path. The comparison is conducted for different graph densities (25%, 50%, 99%) and for two different graph representations: incidence matrix and adjacency list.
